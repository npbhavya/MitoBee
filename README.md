# MitoBee

## Snakemake workflow to get mitogenomes from metagenomic data

### Install 

**Source install**
Run the below commands:

    git clone https://github.com/npbhavya/MitoBee.git
    cd MitBee
    mamba create -y -n mitobee python=3.13
    conda activate mitobee
    pip install -e . 

**Downloading the test-files** 

The test files are large, so to download them, use `git-lfs`, Needed if you want to test the installation with the test files

**Once I have a stable version release, I will upload them to conda and pip as well**

### Running the code
Note: This code works only on paired end metagenomes for now. 

This workflow is made modular; 

1. `mitobee run` 
If there is a representative closely related genome mitogenome, provide that as the host seq and get started

```
    #Running mitobee with test files available in the repo
    mitobee run --input test-files/metagenomes --extn fastq.gz \
         --pattern_r1 _R1 --pattern_r2 _R2 \
         --sequencing paired \
         --host_seq test-files/am-dh4.fasta \
         --output output
```

2. `mitobee tree`
Once the mitochondrial genomes are built from each metagenome sample, run this module to build a tree with these mitogenomes and other references

```
    #After the mitogenomes are made from the mitobee run results. Add other references to build a tree
    #Once again example with test files
    mitobee tree --input test-files/mitogenomes --extn fasta --host_seq test-files/am-dh4.fasta --output output -k all

```

3.  `mitobee search`
If there is a no closely related mitogenome available, then this step can be run first to search against a set of mitogenomes or mito genes 
This module will provide an overview of which reference to use

```
    #If a closely related mitochondrial genome is not available, but a gene is, like cox  or rRNA genes
    #Download the reference genes you would like to use of the closely related genomes

    #to search against mitogenomes refernece set
    mitobee gene --input test-files/mitogenomes --extn fasta --ref_seq  test-files/ref --output output -k all --mitogenome

    #to search against mitogenomes refernece gene set 
    mitobee gene --input test-files/mitogenomes --extn fasta --ref_seq  test-files/ref --output output -k all --genes 

```

**HPC version:** 
To run mitobee on HPC

Job script (SLURM format) provided in `mitobee.sh` file in repository. Update the account, job specs for your cluster.

- Also note the `--profile slurm` in the command requires a file `~/.config/snakemake/slurm/config.yaml` in your HPC $HOME. \
  If this file doesn't exist, create the file and add

```
    executor: slurm
    jobs: 100 #update this accordingly if the number of jobs per user is smaller on your cluster

    default-resources:
      slurm_account: <slurm account> #ignore if this not required in your cluster
      slurm_partition: cpu
      mem_mb: 100000
      runtime: 100

    latency-wait: 120
    restart-times: 2
    rerun-incomplete: true
    printshellcmds: true
    use-conda: true
    keep-going: true
```
### Input files
Input files:
- Input directory with metagenomes
- Reference directory
  - If running `run`  or `tree` module, provide a **(one)** reference genome. 
  - If running `gene` module, provide a reference gene set

### Output files
Output files: Provide the output folder, contains subdirectories
- PROCESSING: Folder containing intermediate files
- REPORTS: Final results including the mitogenome fasta files from (hopefully) each metagenome sample \
      Also inlcudes the QC reports, to include stats on how many reads were processed, and not
